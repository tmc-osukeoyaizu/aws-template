"""
This is an example of a program for your first day at Coders Campus.
It starts by defining a message (msg) and a file name (filename), then generates a banner with the message, prints the banner and saves it the file in the local directory.
The program defines a bucket (bucket_name) and uploads the file generated in the filesystem location to that bucket on Amazon S3.
